#0.027,0.100,-0.1140,0.0100 for 2002fk does not have a well matched convertion to SATL s (and reported in Moreno-Raya2016a)
#0.32,0.51,-0.11,0.032 has a better convertion to s, but worse looking lc. -- I should see what I get without u band
#x_1 values can be compared to Moreno-Raya2016a with s =  0.98 + 0.091x_1 + 0.003x_1^2 − 0.00075x_1^3
