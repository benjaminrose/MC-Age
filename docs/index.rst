=======================================================
MC-Age --- Estimating Stellar Population Ages with FSPS
=======================================================

About
=====
This project uses FSPS, and python-FSPS to estimate the age of a stellar populations from a photometric SED. The code is available on github_.

.. _github: https://github.com/benjaminrose/SNIa-Local-Environments

Science goal
============

Check local environment effects on SNIa by looking for correlations between HR and the age of the local environment calculated from SDSS Scene Modeling Photometry
